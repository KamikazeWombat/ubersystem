  <h2>Check MITS Application</h2>
  If you believe you've already filled out the MITS application, please enter the email address of anyone in the studio set to <em>receive emails</em>.
  By default, this is the person who originally filled out the application.

  <br/><br/>If you have applied for MITS, you will receive a confirmation email (usually within 5 minutes). If you do not receive this email, and it is not in your Spam or Junk folder, please contact us at {{ c.MITS_EMAIL|email_to_link }}.
