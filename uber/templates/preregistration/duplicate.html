        It looks like your {{ c.DEALER_REG_TERM }} application has not been approved yet. If your application
        is not approved, you will be able to purchase badges for yourself and the number of assistants on the application
        at the pre-registration price of ${{ '%0.2f' % attendee.badge_cost }} when the waitlist is exhausted. You will receive an email
        when these badges are available for purchase.

        You were registered automatically for a complementary Staff badge as thanks for volunteering
        last year.  You should have already received an email letting you know about this; if you didn't
        then please contact us via <a href='{{ c.CONTACT_URL }}'>{{ c.CONTACT_URL }}</a> and let us know.

    If you're absolutely sure that this is someone else, you can continue and pay for this registration.
