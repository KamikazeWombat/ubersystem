Ahoy {{ game.studio.primary_contact_first_names }},

Congrats on presenting at the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase! 

We want to know if you would like to run a Leaderboard Challenge or Tournament at the Showcase.

* To run a Leaderboard Challenge your game should have a way to track a high score, distance, or highest level of some sort. 

* To run a Tournament your game should contain some sort of head to head mode where a Single Elimination bracket can be used.

There will be time slots for each game, but a tournament can go past your slotted time. We will be entering these times into Guidebook which attendees will be able to see at the event. 

If you are interested, please email mivs@magfest.org ASAP. 

Forever your Fan,
The MIVS Team
