Ahoy {{ game.studio.primary_contact_first_names }},

We had two opportunities we wanted to share with you:

====
1. Participating in MAGFest Versus
2. Panelists for Indie Game Preservation Panel

1. Participating in MAGFest Versus
====
We're looking for viable candidates to feature in 2020's MAGFest Versus! What is MAGFest Versus?  See a previous year at https://youtu.be/hGPr_9A0Qzg

Do you want your game to be part of it?

If so, you should be capable of producing a MAGFest Versus specific build of your game which has:
* support for 4-player (2v2) style team games with two teams.
* Some kind of clear team designation (with a YELLOW and a RED team)
* A 60 second time limit
* The ability to determine a clear winner at the end of this time limit (either by score, or points, etc)

If you are interested, email {{ c.MIVS_EMAIL|email_only }}

2. Panelists for Indie Game Preservation Panel
====
Andrew Borman from The Strong Museum of Play is leading a "Indie Game Preservation and You" Panel and writes:

"Discover The Strong National Museum of Play's efforts to preserve independent games and how developers can help preserve their history.

I am looking for around 2 to 4 indie game developers to join me on the panel, to talk about the sort of materials they create during the game development process. There will be a brief introduction.

The idea is to have a discussion about how to best preserve those materials for future generations, knowing that there are a wide variety of tools used to create digital objects in varied formats, and how we might keep those things accessible. I would love to highlight some of the work being created as well, through screenshots, pictures, and video."
