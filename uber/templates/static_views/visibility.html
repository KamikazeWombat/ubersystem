<p>
If you are having trouble filling your shifts, changing the visibility may
help. The options are described below:
</p>

<b>Members of this department</b>
<p style="padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 3px;">
  This is the default. Only staff/volunteers who have been assigned to
  your department may sign up for these shifts.
</p>

<b>All volunteers</b>
<p style="padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 3px;">
  Any volunteer may sign up for these shifts, even if they aren't 
  assigned to your department.
